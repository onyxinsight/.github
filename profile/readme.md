# Onyx Insight



Onyx Insight is a green tech company headquartered in Nottingham UK, with offices around the world. We monitor turbines on behalf of energy companies and write the software to perform self-monitoring and predictive maintenance. We collect data from our award-winning ecoCMS hardware and from industrial SCADA systems.

Our technology stack on the backend utilises Python (Django, NumPy, Pandas and many other common libraries), PostgresSQL, and C#/ASP.NET, and our new frontend development is an SPA with React (Axios, React-Query, MaterialUI). We utilise a number of AWS services such as RDS, EC2, ECS, Lambda and S3, and spin up our infrastructure with Terraform.
